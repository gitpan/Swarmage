  - SQLite with multiple sessions was causing grief, so switched to
    BerkeleyDB backend.
  - Local queues are now accessed synchrnously. This is to avoid
    unnecessary spawning of processes only to be able to asynchronously
    access the backing storage
  - Make the workers share the same local queue object.
