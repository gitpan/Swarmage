0.01000_03 25 Dec 2007
  - Fix merge blunder. Swarmage::Worker should now work.
  - Add Swarmage::Worker::POE backend. This allows integration with
    other POE applications without needing to rely on a separate process.

0.01000_02 24 Dec 2007
  - SQLite with multiple sessions was causing grief, so switched to
    BerkeleyDB backend.

    unnecessary spawning of processes only to be able to asynchronously
    access the backing storage
  - Make the workers share the same local queue object.

0.01000_01 21 Dec 2007
  - Complete rewrite. 
    * This is a completely different system with the same name.
    We've learned it the hard way, now shifting gears.

  - Asynchronous Queue access.
  - Simpler interface
  - Worker clusters
